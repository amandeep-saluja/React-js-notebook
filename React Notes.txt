React is a javascript library and not a framework.
-----------------------------------------------------
React class-2:

How to add react into our app:

We have to import the React library in our code by several ways:

1. add react js files from cdn using script tag
2. add react files using bundler

Bundlers: It is responsible for a lot of things in our app to make it production ready.
Like:
It makes our code:
-> Minified
-> Optimize code
-> Tree shaking
-> remove console log

Some recommended Bundlers available in market:
-> Webpack
-> Parcel
-> Vite

Parcel is a bundler package, that is used to bundle our code and make our app production ready.

Package manager: -> Package repository (NPM/yarn)
We need NPM package manager to pull parcel package into our code.

For creating package management file in our code, package.json to keep package manager configurations.
npm init -> will create new package.json file

npm install -D parcel

caret vs tilde

package-lock.json -> will lock the exact version of dependency

Install react package using npm
npm install -D react
npm install -D react-dom

How to ignite our app

npx parcel index.html

React class-3


JSX

Babel

	React.createElement => React object => HTML(DOM)

React Components:
	Functional Components
	Class based Components

Note:
		const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Heading");

		const head = (
		  <div>
			{heading} //-> heading returns react object
		  </div>
		);

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class-4

For breaking code into components and use it again we have to use something knows as import and export keywords.
Exporting from module:

	-> Named export: 	Can be multiple
	-> Default export:  Can only be one


Import from module:

	-> Named import: 	Can be multiple
	-> Default import:  Can only be one

example:

	import Header from './components/Header';

	import {Title} from './components/Header';

	This is not object destructuring.

If it is object destructuring, then we should be able to do this,,,

	import obj from './components/Header'

	const {Title} = obj; //not valid

	obj.Title // not valid

But we can do something like this ->

	import * as Obj from './components/Header';

	Obj.Title

So, React is a default export from react library.

For default imported element should not be necessary to be same name as default export name.

	import Head from './components/Header'; // this will work as Head denotes Header

Also, we can import both together as shown below:
	import Header, { Title } from "./components/Header";
Even,
	import Header, { Title } from "./components/Header.js";
	import Header, { Title } from "./components/Header.jsx";

We can also do this,
	import * as XYZ from "./components/Header";

	<XYZ.Header />

same as

	<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
----------------------------------------

React uses one way data binding only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class-5/class-6
State variable or React hook

	react creates Virtual dom and to know react that something will change on an event, we attach a hook between data and virtual dom's element.
	So whenever there is an event triggered, react re-render that part of virtual dom or sub-tree that has used state variable...
	
	React Fiber -> new reconciliation algorithm

	while reconciliation react used diff algorithm to check difference between the virtual DOM's previous state and current state.

	React only watch it's state variables and re-render it in virtual dom.
	
useEffect is a react hook that calls when component is rendered.
	
useEffect callback function takes a call back funtion & dependency array...
and call it at a specific time.

after every rerender useEffect gets called and hence it's callback will be called

useEffect calls when:
	
	-> empty dependency array -> once after first render
	-> dep arrat [searchTxt] => once after initial render + everytime after render ( my searchTxt changes)
	-> if we don't pass any dependency -> it will be called after every render.
	
Never create any component inside component.
Never ever write a useState() inside if else. -> react wont like inconsistency. -> react won;t know if searchTxt variable will be there or not.
Never write a useState inside for loop.


react gives you useState to create local variable inside your component.
Never create a useState react variable outside component

Formik -> npm package used to create forms.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class-7 - Finding the Path

Don'ts
-> Do not create component inside another component. -> It will create render issues.
-> Do not write hooks inside if else statements. -> That will create inconsistency in the state variable.
-> Never write inside the for loop. -> That will cause multiple variable creation in same name.

Note:
-> React gives us useState to create local state variable inside our functional component.
-> Never use useState outside functional component.
-> You can use several useEffects according to their use case.
-> Images are always imported as Named import.

Routing:

To create routing of the application, we have to create routing configuration.
For that we need to use createBrowserRouter() function from react-router-dom package,
that requires array of objects as routing configuration or paths.

-> Routing configuration object requires following properties:
    * path: "/" -> It signifies that if we load page from root path what should happen.
    * element: <AppLayout /> -> pass the tag name that should be load at above path.
    * errorElement: <Error /> -> pass the error tag that should be loaded in case of error.

-> After creating the routing configuration, it just doesn't work unless we provide it to our app.
-> To provide the routing configuration create by createBrowserRouter() function to react render() function
    we need to use RouterProvider component and pass appRouter configuration as props to it.
-> RouterProvider component is named exported by react-router-dom package.

-> To access the error information in Error functional component, react-router-dom provided us
    useRouteError() hook.

-> Routing:
	1. Client side routing
	2. Server side routing

-> Single Page Application (SPA):
    To avoid the server side routing and eliminate the server side routing we will use the client side routing.

-> Problem of anchor tag is that, when we click on it, it will reload the whole page, instead of changing the page.
    It will route at server side and reload the whole page.

-> To create clickable links in page instead of anchor tag that reloads the whole page, react-router-dom package
    have provided us Link component, which is a named exported component, that takes to="/" path, and
     internally converts it to anchor tag (because in the end everything has to be converted into something that
     browser understand) and keeps a track of it, so that whenever it is clicked, Link will navigate to corresponding page.

-> To route the nested paths and load the components specified inside children in a specific place, react-router-dom
    provided us an Outlet component (Named exported component), using which we can navigate to desired
    component at specified path.

-> To load the components according to route dynamically we use outlet to fill in with child component.
    All the children of my component go into the outlet according to route.

-> Outlet tag should be kept inside the element's component tag and all the children paths will be replaced with
    the child components in place out outlet.

-> When we goto home page from about page, home page renders 2 times.
    Render -> API call -> Re-Render.

Dynamic Segments/Dynamic Routing:
-> To use the params from routing path react-route-dom package provided us something known as useParams() hook.
-> It will help to read dynamic URL params

class-8 - Let's get Classy
==========================

Routing
    -> How to make a route? -> react-router-dom
    -> Learn and try to use various ways to create routers:
        1. createBrowserRouter (Recommended)
        2. createHashRouter
        3. createMemoryRouter
    -> Nested route inside a route -> Children of children
    -> To render the nested child, an Outlet is to be created or child tag is need to be added in parent.

    -> If you want to create a route in continuation of parent route, don't add / before it.
    -> If u add / before a route, it will create a route from root.

    -> Outlet will render that component inside itself, which child component's route is open.

Routing children of children
	-> parentPath/{path} => localhost:1234/about/profile
	-> children component always rendered inside outlet and we need to create outlet inside it's parent...

Class based components:

	-> messy
	-> iff creating new project, recommended not to create class based component...
	-> non maintainable
	-> To make a class as react component class and not JS class, we use extends React.Component
	-> mandatory method to override is -> render() {}
	-> React watches for the change in props and re-renders the component.
	-> Just like Functional Component has state, CBC also has it's state.

	-> If we want to access the props inside constructor of CBC, we have to pass the props to super()
	    else we will not be able to access the props, and we get undefined.
	    This is because React have not assigned the props to the context (this) inside the constructor,
	    and even we are able to access the props inside the render method using this (context), this is because
	    React assigns the props to instance of the class explicitly after initializing it.
	    see below:
	    //React under the hood
        const instance = new DefinedComponent(props);
        instance.props = props;

	-> we receive props inside `this` keyword.
	-> we have to do this.props.{prop-name}
	-> to create state variables in react, we have to create it inside the constructor,
	    best place to create the state variable, is constructor of class, as the classes are invoked
	-> do not set state variable without set function else react does not know when to trigger reconciliation

React Life Cycle:

    -> useEffect is the best place to call the API, as it calls after the initial render completes.
    -> similarly componentDidMount() is the best place to call the API in CBC.

Order in which life cycle hooks of parent and child component will be triggered:
	Parent - constructor
	Parent - render 
	Child - constructor
	Child - render
	Child - Component did Mount
	Parent - Component did Mount

Order in which life cycle hooks of parent and 2 child components will be triggered:
    Parent - constructor
	Parent - render
        First Child - constructor
        First Child - render
        Second Child - constructor
        Second Child - render
        First Child - Component did Mount
        Second Child - Component did Mount
	Parent - Component did Mount

Lifecycle of React class component
    ->refer-Diagram
        https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

->React Render happens in two Phases
	1. Render phase
		-> calls constructor
		-> calls render -> create virtual DOM and ready to put everything on browser
						-> react batches up everything into one, (that's why if two child component's constructor is called just after render of first child)
	2. Commit phase
		-> React updates DOM & refs
		-> componentDidMount calls
	
componentDidMount will be called after initial render is finished, browser has the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parent Constructor                          ||
Parent render                               ||
	First Child constructor                 ||              Render Phase
	First Child render                      ||
	Second Child constructor                ||              This is the place where react renders all

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Order in which life cycle hooks of parent and child components with async componentDidMount will be triggered:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Parent - constructor                    ||
	Parent - render                         ||              Render phase
    Child - constructor                     ||              Mounting Cycle
    Child - render                          ||

    DOM is updated                          ||
	Parent - Component did Mount            ||              Commit Phase
    json is logged in console               ||              -> calls setState()
    Child - Component did Mount             ||              -> updates the state -> re-render the child component
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Child - render                          ||              Updating Cycle
    Child - componentDidUpdate              ||

    useEffect - return                      ||              <- unmounting phase in FBC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
due to async added in the componentDidMount of child component,
it loaded asynchronously and delays the load of it.

-> When componentDidMount will be called -> Once after first render
-> When componentDidUpdate will be called -> After every render

What that signifies -> It is similar behaviour like useEffect()

Cons of SPA:
    -> When we define a setInterval of 1 sec in componentDidMount, it will start calling callback after each sec
    -> Even if we change the route to some other page in SPA, it does not reload and
        hence setInterval will call even after page change.
    -> Each time, when we revisit the page that has setInterval, it will trigger new setInterval.
        So there will be multiple setInterval started running in background, that are killing the performance.

Research Homework:
Why to use super in constructor?
Why can I make componentDidMount async and not useEffect async?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
class-9 -

How many times componentDidMount gets called? -> once

How many times componentDidUpdate gets called? -> after every state change or props change

Basically update will be triggered only when something changes
by something it can be
    -> setState() called
    -> new props passed
    -> forceUpdate() called

When componentDidUnmount called for ? -> for cleanup

Why do we need hooks?
-> React Hooks uses
    -> reusability (can be used anywhere in code base)
    -> readability (don't have to worry about code written inside it)
    -> maintainability (easy to debug)
    -> testable (test only individual components)
    -> modularity (broken down into meaningful pieces or chunks)

-> Keep commonly usable functions in a common file.
-> That may call as, shared or utils or helper.

Functional component -> It's a function that returns JSX

hooks -> It's a function that does not return JSX but other values
        useParam - returns object
        useState - returns array
        useEffect - returns void
      -> It can return any value. We can offload any functionality to it.
      -> we cannot use hooks inside a normal function. It is accessible inside Functional Component.

helper component
    -> to hold the reusable functions in utils

Custom Hooks
    useOnline
    useLoggedIn
    useLocalStorage

Parcel bundles up the code into 1 JS file, but if our app is very large production level then
it would be difficult to load the page faster, and it will impact out performance.

We can split the code into multiple logical bundles, which can be load when user browse specific module.
We should do chunking of the JS files.

Lazy Loading
    -> Chunking
    -> Code splitting
    -> Dynamic Bundling
    -> Lazy loading
    -> On Demand Loading
    -> Dynamic Import

-> We will use lazy() method from react library, which will need a callback that returns dynamically imported component

    -> It fails to load the component and suspends the rendering, as module takes time to load
    -> It's an SPA. It will not reload, but in second time it has the code loaded in browser and hence it works.

    -> To overcome this error, react give us a component named Suspense from "react" package.
    -> It will take care of the loading of module and render.
    -> Suspense component is present in react package, it takes fallback props to which we need to provide fallback JSX
        to show or component name, such as Shimmer.

Never load the lazy loaded component inside another component.

=====================================

Tailwind CSS - New and popular CSS framework
Base Web - Uber uses
MUI - Material UI - Google
Ant Design - Alibaba Group
Chakra UI
PrimeFlex

Ways to add CSS to our project:
1. native way - style.css
2. SCSS and SASS
3. Inline CSS
4. CSS Framework/Libraries or Component Libraries
5. Styled Components

Pros of using libraries:
1. Reuasability
2. Consistency
3. Easy to write
4. Reduce time
5. no duplicate css
6. code is less
7. Fast development
8. Easy to debug

Cons of using libraries:
1. Loss of control
2. Increased bundle size
3. Too much classes
4. High initial learning curve
5. Readability issues

Tailwind CSS Framework
    -> CSS on the go (in the same file)
    -> Reusability
    -> Less bundle size
    -> Flexible UI (Customizable UI)

Ways to use tailwind CSS
    -> CDN links
    -> NPM package
        -> 1. Install tailwindcss and postcss
            -> npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
            -> npx tailwindcss init
        -> 2. tailwind.config.js
            -> to configure the paths which file will contain tailwind classes
        -> 3. .postcssrc
            -> post css rc file to enable plugin to recognize tailwindcss while parcel bundling
        -> 4. add below lines in style.css, to start parcel recognize tailwind css classes.
            @tailwind base;
            @tailwind components;
            @tailwind utilities;


-> postcss rc file takes this config and tells our project/parcel, we are using so many css files
    compile all the css files into style.css file.
-> Tailwind overrides default css of each tag

-> Box array notation to mention precisely how much i want to provide css in px

class-11 - Data is the new Oil
==============================

Data is the most crucial thing in any production app.

Layers:
    -> UI layer   - what ever we see on the browser page
    -> Data layer - holds data required to be show on UI

UI Layer is build with JSX,(Babel is used to convert the JSX into React Objects),
then React converts it into big object, which is known as Virtual Document Object Model vDOM.
This V-DOM is used for Reconciliation, which calculates Diff. Diff is between current V-DOM and
previous V-DOM, then this diff is sync with actual DOM in browser.

JSX -> React object -> vDOM -> Reconciliation (diff between current vDOM and previous copy of vDOM) -> diff is sync with Real DOM

Data is maintained & managed in the Data Layer in UI using
-> state
-> props

-> there are more ways to manage data in Data Layer.

-> Main difference between state and props is, If we need a variable which has a scope just within that container
    or component, that variable is known as state, it is the local variable.
    Props is the data, we can pass from one component (parent) to another component (child).

-> If we want to pass data from 1 comp to another comp -> we use props
-> If we want to keep data within a container, then we need a local variable -> we use state

PROPS DRILLING
-> If we have a state variable in our super parent, and we need props data into grand child component,
    then we pass the data to child, component by component.
-> We drill down the component to get the data to child component.
    (Props Drilling: a situation where data is passed from one component through multiple interdepedent
    components until you get to the component where the data is needed.)
-> Not a good way, we need to modify all the files to get the props till child.
-> whenever these props are changed, then every component will be re-rendered through which 
    this props is been passed to child. Clutters the code. Unnecessary code and variables in our code.
-> Best way is to shift the control to parent and control the state of all the sections.
-> But if we create state for each section the to save and change value of each section would be extremely difficult,
    better way is to save the state of only shown section.

React Dev Tools
-> Use React Devtools Chrome Extension to debug the props in a very large production app.
-> Profiler will help you to record the whole browsing session, and we can track which component took how much time.
-> Loading time taken by each component.

How to pass the data from children to parent?
-> Very fewer cases, but has many ways to do so.

1. Custom hooks
2. Local storage - Bad way
3. Mobix
4. Context API
5. NGRX
6. Flux
7. Redux

Lifting the state up.

-> Data needs to be maintainable in proper format

-> useContext is a React hook that returns the data from a context, provided by react package
-> createContext is a function that creates context, provided by react package

-> you can give name to  context name by
    UserContext.displayName = "UserContext"
