React is a javascript library and not a framework.

React class-2:

How to add react into our app:

We have to import the react library in our code by several ways:

1. add react js files from cdn using script tag
2. add react files using bundler

Bundlers: It is responsible for a lot of things in our app to make it production ready.
Like:
It makes our code:
-> Minified
-> Optimize code
-> Tree shaking
-> remove console log

Some recommended Bundlers available in market:
-> Webpack
-> Parcel
-> Vite

Parcel is a bundler package, that is used to bundle our code and make our app production ready.

Package manager: -> Package repository (NPM/yarn)
We need NPM package manager to pull parcel package into our code.

For creating package management file in our code, package.json to keep package manager configurations.
npm init -> will create new package.json file

npm install -D parcel

caret vs tilde

package-lock.json -> will lock the exact version of dependency

Install react package using npm
npm install -D react
npm install -D react-dom

How to ignite our app

npx parcel index.html


React class-3


JSX

Babel

	React.createElement => React object => HTML(DOM)

React Components:
	Functional Components
	Class based Components

Note:
		const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Heading");

		const head = (
		  <div>
			{heading} //-> heading returns react object
		  </div>
		);


class-4

For breaking code into components and use it again we have to use something knows as import and export keywords.
Exporting from module:

	-> Named export: 	Can be multiple
	-> Default export:  Can only be one


Import from module:

	-> Named import: 	Can be multiple
	-> Default import:  Can only be one

example:

	import Header from './components/Header';

	import {Title} from './components/Header';

	This is not object destructuring.

If it is object destructuring, then we should be able to do this,,,

	import obj from './components/Header'

	const {Title} = obj; //not valid

	obj.Title // not valid

But we can do something like this ->

	import * as Obj from './components/Header';

	Obj.Title

So, React is a default export from react library.

For default imported element should not be necessary to be same name as default export name.

	import Head from './components/Header'; // this will work as Head denotes Header

Also, we can import both together as shown below:
	import Header, { Title } from "./components/Header";
Even,
	import Header, { Title } from "./components/Header.js";
	import Header, { Title } from "./components/Header.jsx";

We can also do this,
	import * as XYZ from "./components/Header";

	<XYZ.Header />

same as

	<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
----------------------------------------

React uses one way data binding only

-------------------------------------------------------------
State variable or React hook

	react creates Virtual dom and to know react that something will change on an event, we attach a hook between data and virtual dom's element.
	So whenever there is an event triggered, react re-render that part of virtual dom or sub-tree that has used state variable...
	
	React Fiber -> new reconciliation algorithm

	while reconciliation react used diff algorithm to check difference between the virtual DOM's previous state and current state.

	React only watch it's state variables and re-render it in virtual dom.
	
useEffect is a react hook that calls when component is rendered.
	
useEffect callback function takes a call back funtion & dependency array...
and call it at a specific time.

after every rerender useEffect gets called and hence it's callback will be called

useEffect calls when:
	
	-> empty dependency array -> once after first render
	-> dep arrat [searchTxt] => once after initial render + everytime after render ( my searchTxt changes)
	-> if we don't pass any dependency -> it will be called after every render.
	
Never create any component inside component.
Never ever write a useState() inside if else. -> react wont like inconsistency. -> react won;t know if searchTxt variable will be there or not.
Never write a useState inside for loop.


react gives you useState to create local variable inside your component.
Never create a useState react variable outside component

Formik -> npm package used to create forms.

createBrowserRouter -> function to create routers in our project -> and pass the routing configuration

createBrowserRouter-> it takes list of paths 

after creating the routing configuration, it just don't work unless we provide it to our app..

For this use, RouterProvider... and provide the routing configuration to it...

ErrorElement -> error component

Routing ->

	1. Client side routing
	2. Server side routing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single Page Application (SPA):
To avoid the server side routing and eliminate the server side routing we will use the client side routing....

to load the components according to route dynamically we use outlet to fill in with child component.

All the childrens of my component go into the outlet according to route.

to use the params from routing path -> react-route-dom package provided us something known as useParams() hook.

modular
reusable
testable
readable
maintainable
